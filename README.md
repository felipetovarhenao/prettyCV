# PrettyCV
## Description

This is a personal Python utility for converting a JSON-formatted [curriculum vitae](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipetovarhenao/felipetovarhenao.github.io/main/src/json/cv.json) and [creative portfolio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipetovarhenao/felipetovarhenao.github.io/main/src/json/work-catalog.json) to a docx/pdf document.

You can see the resulting document [here](https://d2cqospqxtt8fw.cloudfront.net/personal-website/cv.pdf)

Although it's very specific to my needs and unlikely to be useful out-of-the-box to anybody but me, feel free to use it as a starting point to create your own CV.
